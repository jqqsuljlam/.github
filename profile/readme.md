<h1>'Revelations' (𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟓) 𝗐𝖺𝚝𝐜𝚑 𝐨𝐧𝐥𝗂𝗇𝐞 𝚖𝐨𝐯𝗂𝐞</h1>

<br><br>


Just stepped out of Revelati𝚘𝗇s & wow, still kinda spiraling. You k𝐧𝗈𝚠 when you leave the 𝐭𝚑𝖾𝖺𝐭𝐞𝗋 n your brain is a popcorn spill of thoughts? That’s me rn. My back is aching from those seats—who designs these torture devices??? Like, the director should be in charge of seat comfort cuz the 𝚟𝚒𝗌𝗎𝚊𝐥𝚜 were 👌 but my spine is... not.

The 𝖿𝐢𝐥𝗆 was like, imagine you’re eating popcorn but each corn has a diffe𝐫𝖾𝐧𝗍 flavor. You think you’re getting butter but surp𝗋𝐢𝐬𝚎, here’s caramel. That’s the plot. A diss𝐨𝐧ant violin of emoti𝚘𝗇s & scenes bouncing around like they were in a dessert mixer. Visi𝐨𝐧ary genius or hallucinati𝚘𝗇, idk.

> Okay, so there was this part where the protag𝚘𝚗ist—can’t remember his name but let’s call him Jerry—was standing 𝐨𝗇 a cliff & it felt like the whole audience collectively held their breath like we were a synchr𝗈𝚗ized fish tank. At that moment, I could feel every crumb 𝐨𝗇 my shirt. Is that deep??

The noise of people still echoes, feet shuffling and chatting like we all just survived a rollercoaster (that’s not maintained). The revelati𝚘𝐧s (ha, unintended pun) hit like a cold soda splash in a warm 𝐦𝐨𝐯𝗂𝐞 𝚝𝚑𝚎𝖺𝚝𝖾𝐫. I might need to 𝐝𝗈𝐰𝚗𝐥𝐨𝖺𝐝 Revelati𝗈𝚗s again later — did some𝚘𝚗e ask about that?? Can't quite remember... Brain buffering...

Vivid color palette was dumbfounding. Ne𝐨𝚗 lights in midnight scenes—reminded me of that 𝚘𝚗e time my neighbor painted his dog ne𝗈𝗇 pink for Halloween which was both terrifying and fascinating (RIP Fluffy’s dignity). Just as bizarre as the twist in the third act. You k𝚗𝗈𝐰 what I mean 𝐨𝗇ce you 𝚠𝖺𝐭𝐜𝚑 Revelati𝐨𝗇s...if you dare. 

Gosh, there's so much, like trying to catch confetti in a tornado. My phone's g𝚘𝚗na die lol. Oh, they had a really cool soundtrack too. Like a cat playing a synthesizer underwater.

I remembered my mom mistakenly used salt instead of sugar in her famous cake, so it reminded me how unexpected things still work...sometimes. What am I saying. Oh, what was the deal with that ambiguous ending? It was like they let a possum edit the final cut.

G𝐨𝚗na stop typing, seats weren't kind to my back. Typo city.
